# A Brief History
- DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain of physical manufacturing and leadership to the IT value stream

## The Lean Movement
- Two of Lean's major tenets (principles) include the belief that:
    - The *manufacturing lead time* (the required to convert raw materials into finished goods) was the best predictor of quality, customer satisfaction, and employee happiness
    - One of the best predictors of short lead times was small batch sizes of work

## The Agile Manifesto
- A lightweight set of values and principles against heavyweight software development processes such as waterfall development and methodologies such as the Rational Unified Process
    - Waterfall development: A linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one, there's little room for revisions once a phase is finished
    - Rational Unified Process (RUP):
        - A framework developed by Rational Software (now owned by IBM) that provides an approach to software development, RUP divides the development process into four major phases:
            1. Inception: Defining the project's scope and requirements at a high level
            2. Elaboration: Analyzing the problem domain, refining requirements, and designing the system architecture
            3. Construction: Building the software prpduct through iterative cycles, including coding and testing
            4. Transition: Deploying the roduct to users, fixing bugs, and preparing for production

## The Continuous Delivery (CD) Movement
- Building upon the development discipline of continuous build, test, and integration, the concept extended to *continuous delivery* which defined the role of a "deployment pipeline"
